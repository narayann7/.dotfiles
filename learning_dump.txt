how to create a file?

#!/bin/bash   #path

echo hello world

ls -l to check permission

chmod +x file_name.sh //to give permission

./file_name.sh #to run


name="narayan"
echo helo is $name
echo "hello its ${name}"

echo "hello testing" > test.txt #will store the output 

cat > text.txt //as editor

: '
multi line commment

'
#not a comment but still act as comment


# if [ $name -eq 10  ]
# then
# 	echo good
# elif [ exp ]
# then 
#    echo cool
# else
# 	echo bad
# fi

-eq = equal
-nq = not equal
-gt = greater than

> ,< , =  will also work

if (($name == 10 ))||(($name == 11 ))

while (($name !=0))
do
	echo $name
	name=$((name-1))
done

# until (($name ==0))
# do
# 	echo $name
# 	name=$((name-1))
# 	# if (($name == 5))
#  #    then

# done

until same as while but until the condion becomes true
